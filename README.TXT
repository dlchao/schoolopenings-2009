Sample of school opening dates in the continental United States, 2009

We gathered public school start dates in the continental United States in 2009.
For some states, reasonably complete school opening dates for a state could be obtained from state department of education websites.
For one state (Indiana), data was obtained from an employee of the state.
For the remaining states, we randomly chose 25 school districts from each state and found their school calendars online.
The data are in csv format, with each column containing data for a state (or the District of Columbia) and each row containing an opening date.

The data were gathered by Dennis Chao, Robin Webb, Diane Wagener, and Karen Lane.
